            __Graphika Manila Interational Multimedia Conference__ is the premiere
            multimedia and graphic design event in the Philippines.  Since 2006,
            Graphika Manila has attracted over 7,500 design students and
            professionals and is now hailed as one of the most influential
            multimedia events in the country.

            As it celebrates its seventh year running, Graphika Manila once more
            brings together Manila's creative minds to listen to inspiring
            stories and celebrate the works of the best multimedia and graphic
            designers from the Philippines and from around the globe.

            Simply put it as a creative symposium with speakers from different
            fields of the creative arts. The conference focuses on the creative
            side of design rather than technology.
