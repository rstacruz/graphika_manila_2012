          __Graphika Manila Interational Multimedia Conference__ is the premiere
          multimedia and graphic design event in the Philippines.  Since 2006,
          Graphika Manila has attracted over 7,500 design students and
          professionals and is now hailed as one of the most influential
          multimedia events in the country.

          As it celebrates its seventh year running, Graphika Manila once more
          brings together Manila's creative minds to listen to inspiring
          stories and celebrate the works of the best multimedia and graphic
          designers from the Philippines and from around the globe.

          Simply put it as a creative symposium with speakers from different
          fields of the creative arts. The conference focuses on the creative
          side of design rather than technology.
